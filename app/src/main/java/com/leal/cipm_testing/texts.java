By 1965, it was cut in half, to 17 percent -- all before President Lyndon Johnson’s so-called War on Poverty. But after that war began in 1965, poverty began to flat line.

            "Don’t get me wrong. I’m all for fun, but I’m interested in something deeper here—like happiness. I’m certainly not saying that marriage should be the first topic of conversation. At least wait until the pizza is served (just kidding). But I am saying that you need to ask yourself this question: Why do you want to go on a date with someone? Physical attraction? That’s important. Common interest in something? Also important. But what else?\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Let’s face it, most of the time, we—and by “we” here, I’m referring to women—have no idea. We have no plan. That’s okay as far it goes. But “as far as it goes” is not very far. And, frankly, not very smart.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "But let’s play out the scenario. We too often assume that relationships have levels of commitment, progressing—if they progress at all—like video games. A hookup is level one, dating is level two; level three—living together. And then, after we’ve had those, maybe we’re ready for marriage.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "But in fact, relationships usually don’t progress that way. Hookups arise out of whim, impulse, or simple attraction. Dating is often based on compatibility or convenience, and sometimes on the hope that something serious might develop. Living together may be based on real love and a tryout for marriage. But it can also be based on less serious considerations, like lack of other opportunities, desire for a roommate, or the inability to afford a single apartment.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "But marriage is a different enterprise entirely. Those looking for a good marriage are looking for someone who wants to build a shared life. They’re looking for someone who shares their values and beliefs―moral, political, and, where applicable, religious. They view each other not only as a “partner,” but as something even more profound: husband and wife.\n" +
            "\n" +

Little wonder: Study after study shows that those in good marriages are happier, healthier, even wealthier, than those who are not. Like anything you want, you have to work toward it. And anything that isn’t moving you toward your goal is a waste of time.\n" +

            "What’s the difference between living with someone and marriage?

            "\n" +

            "\n" +
            "Violent crime is highly concentrated.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "We know where violent crimes are likely to be committed: drug houses, gang hangouts, a problem bar. Crime “hot spots.”\n" +

            "\n" +
            "But more importantly, we know who commits violent crimes: they’re called the Power Few.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "In any given city, just five percent of criminals are responsible for 50 percent of all violent crimes. I want to make this abundantly clear: it’s not five percent of the total population of a city that is driving the majority of violent crime; it’s five percent of the criminals—a subset of a subset. Targeting this small cohort of high-frequency offenders can substantially reduce violent crime rates throughout an entire city.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Second: Go After the Drug Dealers and Gun-Toting Felons\n" +
            "\n" +
            "You don’t have to dig very deeply into crime statistics to discover that drug dealers and felons in possession of firearms are linked to many violent crimes, especially homicides.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "These are the people who are not only likely to kill but to be killed.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "So if law enforcement focuses on drug dealers and gun-toting felons, they’ll reduce the number of both potential killers and potential victims on the street.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "But targeting drug dealers has an added benefit, one that’s lost on the public, but well-known to law enforcement. \n" +
            "\n" +
            "Drug dealers, often part of drug gangs, have the best information about homicides and all sorts of other crimes. \n" +
            "\n" +
            "Any investigator who interrogates a drug-dealing gang member will likely soon discover that the defendant has witnessed or participated in multiple shootings, both fatal and non-fatal. In addition, that same defendant will know about a score of other crimes—everything from robberies to carjackings to organized retail theft rings. And if he is facing a long sentence, there’s a good chance he’ll give up that information.\n" +

            "\n" +
            "When police and prosecutors collaborate from the inception of an investigation, good things happen. This is a concept known as vertical prosecution.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Working as a team, police and prosecutors discuss targets, timing of arrests, and legal issues like whether a search warrant is required. Once the investigation is completed, the police remain involved at the trial stage helping to determine the order of witnesses, trial themes, and even jury selection.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "This style of collaboration is resource and time intensive, but it pays big dividends. There’s no blaming each other for a poor investigation or bad trial strategy because everybody participated in all aspects of the case.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "When the prosecutors and police work together, particularly in major cases like homicides, the cases are better investigated, legal errors are minimized, the system works as intended. In short, justice is done.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "On the other hand, and this seems to be happening more and more in America today, when the prosecutors and police are actively hostile towards one another, the only people who win are the criminals.\n" +

            "\n" +
            "In two separate studies, in 2020 and 2022, the United States Sentencing Commission, an independent federal agency, took up this question. Their analysis involved thousands of federal inmates over multiple decades.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "Their conclusion was clear: once prison sentences get to five years in length, the longer the prison sentence, the less likely the criminal will commit another crime.\n" +

            "\n" +

            "\n" +
            "Two, the age-crime curve tells us that most violent criminals commit the majority of their crimes from their late teens into their 20s. Prison sentences of over five years simply take these violent criminals out of circulation when they are at their most dangerous.\n" +
